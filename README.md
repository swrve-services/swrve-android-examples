What is Swrve
-------------
Swrve is a single integrated platform delivering everything you need to drive mobile engagement and create valuable consumer relationships on mobile.  
This repository contains additional examples of how to use the Swrve Android SDK.

Examples
--------
* [Splash Screen Example](/SplashScreenExample/) - There can be issues when an In App Campaign is triggered while a splash screen is showing. This is an example of how to prevent these issues by preventing the Splash Screen from being destroyed until after the In App Campaign is dismissed.
* [User Sample ID](/UserSampleId/) - An example of how to implement a class which allows you to send a user property from 1-100 for each user. This user property can then be used to separate users into target groups and compare different marketing strategies.
* [AppStoreReview](/AppStoreReview/) - An example of how to use Swrve Embedded Campaigns to trigger the Google Play In-App Review API.
